mod_psldap
===========

Version 0.77
by David Picard

This module was originally based on Alexander Mayrhofer's mod_auth_ldap,
version 0.5.

sha1 algorithm originally by Steve Reid, modified by Alexander Mayrhofer - 
eliminated by David Picard in version 0.71 (using the apache sha1 functions)

LDAP authentication and access module for Apache web server
(http://www.apache.org/).

This module allows the web user to authenticate against an LDAP store and
manage information in the LDAP store.

For history of this module, review the ChangeLog file. The latest version of
this module can be acquired at http://www.psind.com:8080/projects/mod_psldap/

Feature Summary
================

This module is intended to provide LDAP authentication and maintenance services
specific to each VirtualServer running under an Apache web server. The features
provided by this module are as follows:

Authentication Features:
1.  Direct authentication of a user against an LDAP server.
2.  Authentication against an LDAP server given the user's knowledge of an
    attribute setting in the LDAP tree for their record.
3.  Allow identification of the branch of the LDAP tree under which the user
    must be located.
4.  Allow for function with LDAP servers configured to enforce high levels of
    security.
5.  Support for kerberos based access to an LDAP server.
6.  Allow for group identification based on an attribute in the user's record.
    This functionality will not preclude authentication should no group be 
    identified.
7.  Allow for caching of LDAP authentication information to reduce server
    traffic and improve performance.


Maintenance Features:
1.  Allow the web user to query the LDAP server for information, within the
    limits of their privileges on the server. The module will generate an XML
    representation of the LDAP records that meet the query criteria requested
    by the user. This module will optionally apply an XSL transformation to
    the generated XML and return the resultant document to the user.
2.  Allow the user to edit any attributes in his/her own record, given
    he/she is granted read/write access to those attributes by the LDAP server.
    This feature assumes the attribute name in the LDAP server is used as the
    value name in a POST operation.
3.  Allow the LDAP administrator to edit any record in the LDAP server.
4.  Optionally denies access to all LDAP maintenance functionality if the web
    user is not accessing this module through an https connection.



Compile with Apache
====================

Prerequisites

In order to build mod_psldap you will need at a minimum, an ldap library and a
build environment (compiler, linker, pre-processor, etc...) installed on the
build machine. The mod_psldap module was built and tested against OpenLDAP
version 2.0.23, (downloadable from http://www.openldap.org) but may very well
build with other versions of this library.

In addition to the ldap library, the Apache web server source must be available
or the web server itself must be installed on the build machine. The source can
be acquired from the Apache site (http://www.apache.org) or any mirror sites.

This module can be built in two ways, as a part of the Apache build or through
the Apache apxs utility.


Build Through Apache

Unpack Apache as usual, and change into it's "modules" directory:

   % gzip -dc ../path/to/archive/apache_1.3.23.tar.gz | tar -xv<BR>
   ...
   % cd apache_1.3.23/src/modules

Then, unpack the mod_psldap archive into the modules directory, e.g.

   % gzip -dc ../path/to/archive/mod_psldap-0.6.tar.gz | tar -xv

Configuring, Building, Installing

Change into the newly created "mod_psldap" directory, and configure the 
module itself (some parts of the sha algorithm are endian-dependent, and 
endianess is not checked by the Apache configure script, so the
module comes with it's own autoconf script).

   % cd mod_psldap; ./configure

Now it's time to choose your favorite apache Config options, and additionally
 activate the LDAP authentication module. 

   % cd ../../..; ./configure --prefix=/var/apps/apache \
   --activate-module=src/modules/mod_psldap/mod_psldap.c

After Apache has been configured to your choice, make and install it as usual:

   % make
   ...
   % make install

Apache also provides a mechanism to build the module as a DSO compatible with
a precompiled apache server. To compile the module independently, use the apxs
utility:

   (with Apache 1.3...)
   % apxs -o mod_psldap.so -c mod_psldap.c -lldap -llber

   (... or Apache 2.0 ...)
   % apxs -c mod_psldap.c -lldap -llber
   % apxs -i -a -n psldap mod_psldap.la


Summary Description of Configuration Parameters
===============================================

PsLDAPHosts        - List of LDAP hosts which should be queried

PsLDAPBindDN       - DN used to bind to the LDAP directory, if binding with
      provided credentials is not desired. This value is also used to initially
      bind to acquire the DN of the authenticating user.

PsLDAPBindPassword - The password corresponding to PsLDAPBindDN

PsLDAPBaseDN       - The DN in the LDAP directory which contains the per-user
      subnodes

PsLDAPUserKey      - The key in the directory whose value contains the username
      provided with the authentication credentials

PsLDAPPassKey      - The key in the directory whose value contains the password
      provided with the authentication credentials

PsLDAPGroupKey     - The key in the directory whose value contains the groups
      in which the user maintains membership

PsLDAPUserGroupAttr - The LDAP schema attribute of the user which is used to
      identify the user as a group member. Default value is 'dn'.

PsLDAPGroupMemberAttr - The LDAP schema attribute of the group object used to
      identify each user in the LDAP group. Default value is 'uniqueMember'.

PsLDAPGroupNameAttr - The LDAP schema attribute of the group object used to
      uniquely identify the group. Default value is 'cn'.

PsLDAPSearchScope  - Set Scope when searching in LDAP. Can be 'base',
      'onelevel', or 'subtree'

PsLDAPAuthoritative - Set to 'off' to allow control to be passed on, if the
      user is unknown to this module

PsLDAPUseLDAPGroups - Set to 'on' to lookup the user's group using LDAP groups
      rather than using an LDAP user record's attribute to identify the group
      directly. Default value is 'off'.

PsLDAPAuthSimple   - Set to 'on' if authentication is to be performed by
      acquiring an attribute from the LDAP server with the configured
      credentials.

PsLDAPAuthExternal - Set to 'on' if authentication is to be performed by
      binding with the user provided credentials

PsLDAPAuthUseCache - Set to 'on' if authentication will check the cache prior
      to querying the LDAP server

PsLDAPBindMethod   - Set to 'simple', 'krbv41', or 'krbv42' to determine
      binding to server

PsLDAPSecureAuthCookie - Set to 'off' if cookies are allowed to be sent
      across an unsecure connection

PsLDAPAuthCookieDomain - Set to a domain string if cookies are allowed to be
      used across servers in a domain

PsLDAPCryptPasswords - Set to 'on' if the LDAP server maintains crypted
      password strings

PsLDAPSchemePrefix - Set to 'on' if the LDAP server maintains scheme-prefixed
      password strings as described in rfc2307

PsLDAPCredentialForm - set to the URI that contains the form to capture the
      user's credentials.


Configuring the module
======================

Next step after installing the mod_psldap-enabled Apache is to configure 
it for operation. We'll not talk about general Apache configuration issues, 
please refer to the Apache documentation for that. This page focuses on the
directives introduced by mod_psldap and associated standard directives.

First, let's address some basic Apache configuration settings for
authentication. There are two types of authentication supported by the Apache
web server: Basic and Digest. While Digest authentication is more secure and
can be used over a normal HTTP connection without compromising passwords, not
all browsers fully support Digest authentication. While Basic authentication is
more universally supported, it must be initiated within an SSL session in order
to pass the authentication credentials without risk of compromise. This module
does not currently support Digest authentication, but does fully support Basic
authentication.

To enable Basic authentication, the administrator must specify an authorization
name and the authorization type within a location or directory section in the
apache configuration or htaccess files. The location or directory within which
the AuthName and AuthType are defined will then be protected through Basic
authentication.

    <Location "/someLocation">
        AuthName "Protected information"
        AuthType Basic
        ....
    </Location>

In addition to basic authentication, cookie based authentication is also
supported. Simply specify the AuthType as "cookie" and authentication will be
performed through use of cookies. The username and password are stored in a
plain text form in the cookie by the server and expires with the browser
session. By default, the cookie is only sent across a secure connection. There
is no mechanism for altering the expiration of the cookie on the client. The
cookie may be sent across an unsecure connection by specifying 
PsLDAPSecureAuthCookie to be set to 'off'. The username and password are
captured through a url containing a form that is specified in the 
PsLDAPCredentialForm parameter. In addition, if the credentials are to be used
across different sites within the same domain, the administrator may set the
domain of the cookie by specifying the domain in the PsLDAPAuthCookieDomain
parameter.

Alternatively, the administrator may use the Apache ErrorDocument directive
to cause a form to be provided for the user to enter her credentials when she
is not successfully authenticated or authorized. The administrator may wish
to handle both the 401 & 403 errors in this fashion.

Example:
    ErrorDocument 401 /cookie_auth_form.html
    ErrorDocument 403 /cookie_auth_form.html

To handle the form post, the following lines should be added to your httpd.conf
file.

    # The following is for psldap services:
    <IfModule mod_psldap.c>
      AddType application/x-ldap-update .lde
      AddType ldap-update .ldu
      AddHandler ldap_update_handler .ldu
      <Location /ldapupdate>
        SetHandler application/x-ldap-update
        AuthType Form
      </Location>
    </IfModule>


The content of the form should follow a very specific format. The name for each
input element must coincide with the name of the LDAP field against which
authenticatoin will be performed. The name of each Submit input element must
be FormAction, and the value must be either "Login" or "Cancel". The form might
generally be implemented as follows:

<form name="Change Password" method="POST" action="/ldapupdate">
    <table>
        <tr ><td align="RIGHT"><label>Login (E-Mail)
            <input type="TEXT" name="mail" size="20" maxlength="64" value="" re\
quired></label>
        </td></tr>
        <tr ><td align="RIGHT"><label>Password
            <input type="PASSWORD" name="userPassword" size="20" maxlength="64"\
 value="" required></label>
        </td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="CENTER"><input type="SUBMIT" name="FormAction" value="Lo\
gin"></td>
            <td align="CENTER"><input type="SUBMIT" name="FormAction" value="Ca\
ncel"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</form>


Second, let's address how mod_psldap is enabled to perform authentication
operations under Basic authentication. You will want to select the
authentication method that is most in line with your network topology.

This module supports two different means of authentication with an LDAP server:
with a configured set of credentials (PsLDAPAuthSimple) or with the user
provided credentials (PsLDAPAuthExternal). Keep in mind that connecting with
the configured credentials potentially compromises your LDAP server by
allowing anybody with read access to the http config or htaccess files to view
the configured credentials. You could of course allow an anonymous user access
to your LDAP server with the ability to read the passwords of every user in
your system, but this is definitely worse than exposing the credentials of a
user who is granted read access to the passwords while denying all other users
read access to the password attribute. Of course, granting any user read access
to the password attribute could be considered a serious compromise to the
security of the LDAP server as well. Storing the passwords in the LDAP server
in encrypted form helps to lessen the potential for compromise, but does not
eliminate it.

It's also important to note that PsLDAP supports connectivity to an LDAP server
(PsLDAPBindMethod) using either a simple unencrypted connection (simple), or
one encrypted with either kerberos 4.1 (krbv41) or kerberos 4.2 (krbv42).
      
    ...
    # One of the following must be set to 'on'
    PsLDAPAuthSimple off
    PsLDAPAuthExternal on
    # Set to 'simple', 'krbv41', or 'krbv42' to determine binding to server
    PsLDAPBindMethod simple
    ...

Now we need to decide if PsLDAP is the authoritative authentication mechanism,
will we allow another authentication module to check if the user is
authenticated if authentication fails through PsLDAP? We control this behavior
through the settings indicated by PsLDAPAuthoritative - 'off' indicates yes -
'on' indicates no.

    ...
    PsLDAPAuthoritative on
    ...


Specifying the LDAP Server
============================

By this time, you're probably thinking, "Enough already - how do I tell this
thing about my LDAP server?".  There are several configuration settings that
impact the connection to the LDAP server.

The first connection setting we'll address is how to determine the location of
the LDAP server(s).

    ...
    PsLDAPHosts "myldapserver yourldapserver:9999"
    ...

Note that more than one LDAP server can be specified by separating each server
in the list with a space character. Also, an alternative port can be identified
for a server by following the server name/IP address with a ':' and the
alternative port number.

Next we'll address how to connect to the LDAP servers listed in the PsLDAPHosts
configuration setting.


Binding To An LDAP Server As A User
====================================

By default, mod_psldap tries to bind anonymously to the LDAP directory.

If you want the module to use specific credentials for binding, you can do
that by specifying them in the config section, e.g.: 

   PsLDAPBindDN "mail=webadmin,dc=mycompany,dc=com"
   PsLDAPBindPassword wapassword

Warning! Keep in mind that anybody with read access to those credentials may
be able to use them to gain unauthorized access to your LDAP directory. 
Don't forget to double-check the permissions on the config file.

There's a third method in binding to the directory available: Using the 
credentials supplied by the browser. If you add lines like the following
ones to the config, omitting the settings for PsLDAPBindDN &
PsLDAPBindPassword:

   PsLDAPBaseDN "type=luser,o=psind,c=us"
   PsLDAPUserKey mail
   PsLDAPUserPass userPassword
   PsLDAPAuthExternal on

... the module will bind as the user under the base DN "type=luser,o=psind,
c=us", for an entry whose "mail" attribute value matches the user name passed
by the user through the browser authentication with the browser-supplied
password. If that succeeds, no more password checks are being done, and the
browser supplied credentials are believed to be correct.

If we don't specify the Bind parameters (and therefore didn't add the above
lines to the config file), we'll now have to tell the module where and how to
find the user's credentials in the LDAP directory. If all your users are at the
same level of the directory (e.g. exactly one level below "type=luser,o=psind,
c=us"), and they all have the same key in their RDN (e.g. "webuser=<username>",
the story is rather simple:

   PsLDAPBaseDN "type=luser,o=psind,c=us"
   PsLDAPSearchScope base
   PsLDAPUserKey webuser
   PsLDAPPassKey webpassword

(The last line above tells the module that the user's password is stored in the
attribute named "webpassword". The module will search below "type=luser,
o=psind,c=us" for an entry with an attribute <webuser>=provided_user_name.

Imagine, all your users are still below the same base DN as above, but some of
them have different RDN's. For example, there may be one department storing all
their users using the RDN "surname=<name>", maybe another department chose
"extension=<number>". If all of those entries have their web credentials stored
in the same attributes (e.g. "webuser" and "webpassword" again), you will have
to change one line of the config snippet above:

   PsLDAPSearchScope onelevel

If your users are *not* at exactly one level below the base DN, but scattered
through a specific subtree, you can finally use:

   PsLDAPSearchScope subtree

Again, all those users need to have their credentials in the same attributes,
e.g. once again "webuser" and "webpassword". We go now into comparing the
password supplied by the browser against the value from the user's node in the
LDAP directory.

If we're using PsLDAPAuthExternal the password check is being skipped, because
the password has already been checked by the LDAP server. For clear text
password strings (generally a very bad idea), you don't have to add anything to
the configuration. If your password strings are crypted, you'll have to add

   PsLDAPCryptPasswords on

to your config snippet. Please be aware, that if you have crypted passwords in
the directory, and don't set this option to "on", users will be able to
authenticate successfully using the crypted(!) password string which may not be
what you want... ;-)

There is a third alternative: use scheme prefixed passwords as described in 
RFC 2307. This seems to be the preferred method to store passwords in
Netscape's directory server. You can enable scheme prefixed passwords by 
setting

   PsLDAPSchemePrefix on

(Pretty straight forward, isn't it? ;-) mod_psldap will then be able to 
check passwords prefixed with "{crypt}" (Un*X crypt) and "{sha}" (Base64 
encoded SHA1 digests as described in FIPS-180-1). Case of the prefix 
strings doesn't matter.

Setting Up Your Groups
======================

Ok, we've finally checked the user's password, we can open the gates... 
except if only members of specific groups are permitted to enter. In this 
case, we need to tell mod_psldap the name of the attribute listing the 
user's memberships, e.g. by adding:

   PsLDAPGroupKey webgroup

What if you want to use LDAP groups? Maybe you'd like the added protection of
having the group membership outside of the user's record and don't want to
worry about attribute level permissions in your LDAP configuration. Or perhaps
you'd like to set up a group administrator without allowing them administrative
access to the record's of the user's in their groups.

Simply turn on LDAP group based authentication by setting the following:

    PsLDAPUseLDAPGroups on
    PsLDAPUserGroupAttr dn
    PsLDAPGroupMemberAttr uniqueMember
    PsLDAPGroupNameAttr cn

The above settings will set the group validation to work through the LDAP
groups mechanism - specifically using the groupOfUniqueNames schema. It uses
the dn of the user to map to the attribute settings for uniqueMember in the
groupOfUniqueNames record. The group name against which the user is validated
corresponds to the cn attribute set in the groupOfUniqueNames record.

To specify the group to check, regardless of the mechanism used to identify the
group, enter the groups in a comma separated list in the .htaccess or apache
configuration file, e.g. 

   <Limit GET POST>
     require valid-user
   </Limit>

or

   <Limit GET POST>
     require group beerdrinking,beerguzzling
   </Limit>

before you close the Location with

</Location>



Disabling Authentication and Authorization Functions
====================================================
To disable authentication and authorization checking by the module, simply set
the configuration variable PsLDAPEnableAuth to a value of 'off'. Alternatively,
do not set the PsLDAPUserKey in the htaccess or anywhere in the path to the
disabled directory. A failure to set the user key will also disable the modules
A&A functionality.



Enabling Caching
================
Enabling the cache is relatively straightforward, simply add and set the
PsLDAPAuthUseCache parameter in the configuration to 'on'. Caching is off by
default as it is currently experimental. The cache size is hardcoded at 1000
records and purges every fifteen minutes, removing any records from cache
that are older than 15 minutes. Future versions of this module will allow
for some configurability of this behavior.



Setting Up Forms
================
So now you've got everybody you know listed in your LDAP server with all their
critical information ... yeah right. One of the problems with a directory is
that people move, change their ISPs,  change their phone numbers ... and
generally do other things that make them really hard to keep tabs on. Well,
now you can let people update their information in your address book themselves
- or they won't be able to see the nifty pictures of you and your girlfriend
or boyfriend doing the wild thing (if you're more tame like me, they'll miss
out on the pictures of your cute kids doing really cute things).

Creating a form is very easy. Just create a normal web form and set the names
of the input elements to be the names of your ldap attributes. For the Submit
buttons, simply create an input element of type="submit", name="FormAction"
and set the value attribute to one of three strings:
  *  "Update" - causes mod_psldap to update the settings listed on the page
              in the LDAP server.
  *  "Create" - creates the record in the LDAP server.
  *  "Delete" - deletes the record from the LDAP server.
  *  "Disable" - deletes the password of the account, making it inaccessible.
  *  "Login" - performs authentication, sets a auth cookie, and sends the user
              back to the referring page (which should have rejected
              access based on missing credentials).

PsLDAP provides a partial measure of DSML support, it will return a DSML
document (this is an XML document) in response to a form post, to which an
XSLT may be applied. To specify the transform to be applied, set "xsl1" or
"xsl2" on the form when submitting a request. 

I've included a few sample pages in the distribution to provide a starting
point for creating simple and complex pages:
  *  change_info.html - a simple form to change fixed fields
  *  ldap_query.html - a more advanced form to search for and review records
  *  DSML_editform.xsl - allows for editing of a record via an HTML form -
                         with fields limited to those processed by the XSL -
                         representing a fairly extensive selection.
  *  DSML_cards.xsl - allows the user to view only those fields that are
                      populated in a card type of format.
  *  DSML_table.xsl - allows the user to view specified fields that are
                      visible in a tabular format.

In order to enable form processing, the following segment must be added to your
httpd.conf:

    <Location /ldapupdate>
      SetHandler application/x-ldap-update
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "LDAP Update"
      <Limit GET POST>
        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
        # Allow from local network only:
        Allow from 192 10
      </Limit>
    </Location>

Note that we set the AuthType to "Basic". It could also be set to "cookie", but
it should never be set to "form" as the credentials may get confused with
data that is being inserted or modified on any forms.


LIMITATIONS: The multipart/form-data Content-Type is not yet handled.



Some Examples
==============
Let's say you're maintaining the contact information for everyone you know in
your LDAP server. If you want to provide access to your web server to only the people you know, based on their email address and some provided credential,
add the following segment to your apache configuration file:

# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of 
# permissions.  
#
<Directory />
    # Set the default LDAP directory setting for authentication
    PsLDAPHosts "ldap.mydomain.com"
    PsLDAPUserKey mail
    PsLDAPPassKey userPassword
    PsLDAPAuthExternal on
    PsLDAPSchemePrefix on
    PsLDAPGroupKey ou
    PsLDAPBaseDN "dc=mydomain,dc=com"
    PsLDAPSearchScope subtree
</Directory>

NOTE: The configuration options for connecting to the LDAP server can be set at
the Directory or even the server level to avoid repetition across your
configurations - I would highly encourage this -

Why specify the PsLDAPGroupKey to be "ou"? We want to filter by the group in
the require line of the configuration. I only want family members to see the
pictures I post on my website, so I restrict access to pictures on my web
server those people in my LDAP server marked in the ou=Family organizational
unit.

    <FilesMatch "*.jpg">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName family
	require group Family
	require valid-user
    </FilesMatch>
