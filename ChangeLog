About mod_psldap
===================
mod_psldap was created to provide a very lightweight means of managing directory information by leveraging client processing power to render the edit and reporting pages on any web browser without requiring an ActiveX or other binary executable download. It reduces the incremental network traffic for subsequent edits by 95% or more while still providing a very rich AJAX / Web 2.0 enabled user interface.

Segregated tree management scripting and styling
	
Revision 0.93 
===================
Fixed DocumentManager JS API to accomodate browser technology changes - 
mod_psldap now supports XSLT on the client without a round trip to the server 
to reaquire the XML and reset the default XSL

Addition of search status update in the tree div and processing status to
the record editing div in alt_index.html

Implemented window resizing to fit content in editable forms popups

Enabled anonymous access through the module when a user is not provided

Implemented a Register action to force rebinding to ldap with credentials 
provided through the PsLDAPRegBindDN and PsLDAPRegBindPassword parameters 
configured in the Apache configuration for the module

Modified the DSML_editform.xsl to transform for registration specific view
provided the dn attribute on the searchResultEntry node equals 'dc=registered'

Added operational attributes into the attribute set returned when an LDAP 
search is executed, allowing visibility to entryUUID, modifyTimestamp, createTimestamp, creatorsName, among other attributes

Eliminated potential security hole when using cookie based sessions

Modified LDAP session persistance to pull timestamp from the operational 
attribute modifyTimestamp to dtermine last access time for Apache session

Secured session cookies with HttpOnly option to reduce XSS attack risk - pending
identification of browser support

Introduced validation framework in edit tools - invokes any function set in the
psvalidate attribute of an input element in the context of the input element on
form validation passing the argument list identified in a comma separate string
following the function name in the attribute e.g.
psvalidate='psldap_validateMinLength,7'

Introduced 4 standard validation methods: psldap_validateMinLength, psldap_validateMaxLength, psldap_validateEMail, psldap_validatePasswordStrength,

Fixed the configure script - the generated Makefile now provides reliable 
builds, installs, and bundling of the module

Enable drag and drop movement across organizational units and managers in the explorer tree via mouse actions against the image handles on each tree node


Revision 0.92
===================
Moved common capabilities back out of DSML_sitefrags.xsl to leave that 
stylesheet for site specific customizations only - common capabilities are now 
in DSML_commonscript.xsl

Refactored the pageHeader template with pageHeaderWithRefClass to reduce 
duplicate code

Removed some hardcoded values from the DSML_vendors.xsl (enabled automatic 
population of the ldapDomains to all select elements with an id of 'dn') and 
made the template for servicesMgmt site specific

Corrected minor title setting bug on commonscript XSL

Extended vcard to include KEY, REV, PRODID, and CLASS, also fixing IM references
to be compliant with RFC 4770

Fixed generated dsml structure to better match spec - pushed searchResponse 
back under a batchResponse node and change mgmt and org XSL back to reference 
the correct XPath

Fixed improper ServerPath inclusion in fully qualified path assembly - repairs 
issue with XML and XSL file parse for server side operations when recursive path
link is not present


Revision 0.91
===================
Fixes to eliminate infinite loop in the vertical wrap to ensure IE displays the card view correctly and does not hang. This is related to a change in XSL based rendering in IE, requiring deferal of the wrap function call through a timeout.

Introduce session persistence to the LDAP store to offer an alternative to passing credentials in the cookie, replacing content instead with a session id. An additional alternative is also introduced to embed the session id in the URL

Introduced server side XSL transformation - integrated into vcard display for the contact records and in general response handling for blackberry user agents.

Fixed issue with poor handling of '&' in dn for URL reference to jpegPhoto which was causing some transformations to fail due to incorrect XML parsing

Completed the change to DSML response type for jpegPhoto inclusion in the stream to ensure requests from IE return a URL to the photo and not the binary stream while continuing to pass the encoded image to firefox / mozilla based browsers

Established uniform page head elements across all pages through introduction of XSL includes and imports

Introduced performance improvements by adding indexes in the XSL processing.

Introduced first page customizations for handheld user agents - initially only supporting blackberry - to include suppression of JS to wrap columns in the card style. UserAgent parameter added to all xsl templates via the new DSML_sitefrags.xsl inclusion. Telephone dialing, emailing, and SMS functional within handheld devices and tested on the blackberry.

Addition of xmlObjectTemplate parameter to ldapupdate handler and the Present action type to present XML documents directly from the server. Formerly, this was achieved by getting XML documents directly via HTTP get requests, but this did not accomodate agents - such as handheld or mobile phone browsers - that did not perform the transform via XSL. 

Addition of the dlFilename parameter to ldap update handler to allow responses to be provided with an attachment disposition whose filename correlates to the value of the parameter.

PENDING

Development of a registration page to allow users to self-register in the directory. Supplement with a registrations pending page to classify and move users based on their requests to the appropriate groups.

Revision 0.90
===================
Change to alt_index page xsl transformations to enable embedded editing of records

Enabled explicit mime type return setting through BinaryType parameter on the URI - enforced setting 'text/xml' type for dn based queries and create, update, delete operations.

Fixes in XSL to accomodate latest browser releases of firefix and IE

Cleanup alternative index page that leverages AJAX and client side application of XSL transforms to reduce server requests to render detail already available in the DSML response to the browser

Switch alt_index with index to make AJAX processing the default

Modification to basic index page to make display more compact - page layout modifications to reduce framed content

Segregated base DNs for the application into a shared configuration - introduced psldap_config.js to hold configuration settings

Minor CSS style sheet enhancements to accomodate browser changes

Altered image rendering for Mozilla to take advantage of uuencoded jpeg images in the XML - directly embeds image in the transformed page within the image tag. This was disabled inline in the DSML_editform.xsl but can be re-enabled if you are adventurous ;-)

Fixed compilation issues with Apache 2.2 - now compiles and runs. Regression of changes with 2.0 and 1.3 not tested, but believed to be compatible - any issues should be reported to the sourceforge project for mod_psldap.

Repaired cache access error in Apache 2.XX

Introduced ability to move records to other superior nodes in the edit form. This effectively allows for moving records when someone changes organizations or if an organization restructure occurs

Addition of PSI vendor schema

Fixes to column creation / alignment in card display

XML results modified to be in closer alignment to DSML spec and ennabled XML result return and XSL specification / application on all responses

Realignment of address fields to compact edit form display; auto populate postal address from street, city, state and postal code; eliminated form copy prior to submittal on edit form

Introduction of skype calling and yahoo messaging in card view for contacts with skype or yahoo accounts

Fixed display of ISDN and Telex info

===================
Fixed directory and server initialization routines - feedback accounted for.

Revision 0.75
===================
Fixed directory and server initialization routines - untested.

Revision 0.74
===================
Recognized failure to provide credentials as an auth failure, allowing denial after three attempts to authenticate without credentials.

Changed authorization handler to check for existence of user key definition and to decline authorization handling if the key is not defined. Authentication had already been checking this condition. This fixes a crash in the module.

Addition of configuration parameter, PsLDAPEnableAuth to control whether or not A&A is enabled. Set to 'on' by default.

Changed require group parsing to recognize group names with spaces when they are quoted with either single or double quotes. The type of quote used to delineate the group may not be used in the group name.

	
Revision 0.73
===================
Implemented caching array in shared memory leveraging the apache ap_mm APIs.

Addition of caching, controlled by the PsLDAPAuthUseCache parameter, set to off by default

Reuse of existing LDAP connections implemented in acquiring authorization data to improve overall performance in authorization phase.
	
Addition of PsLDAPAuthCookieDomain. The default is to let the cookie domain default to the server domain

Initialization code has been added for Apache 2.0 (Courtesy Gunter Knauf)

Reorganized code to improve readability of mixed Apache 2.0 and Apache 1.3 compatible implementation

===================
Addition of cookie based authentication against LDAP server using forms to 
collect the authentication data.

Made form data accessible to all subrequests by adding it to the subprocess_env
table immediately after acquisition.

Addition of ability to recurse up request_rec chain to acquire authentication
data

Created mechanism to identify pending changes to current record when ldap
records are updated through forms (experimental - not exposed).

	
Revision 0.70
===================
Initial work started on the processing of LDAP requests within the module

	
Revision 0.63
===================
Addition of LDAP group authentication through the addition of the following
parameters: PsLDAPUseLDAPGroups, PsLDAPUserGroupAttr, PsLDAPGroupMemberAttr,
PsLDAPGroupNameAttr. The default is to not use LDAP based group authorization.



Revision 0.62
===================
	
Changed auth_ldapsearchscope member of ldap_auth_config_rec. Implemented a new mechanism to initialize the value on reading from the config file.

Addition of AuthLDAPBindAsFoundUser configuration parameter to bind as the user found in the filter. This differs from the AuthLDAPBindAsUser functionality as it does not assume the search base concatenated to the user key represents the DN. It should be noted that the password need only match the first eight letters when this mechanism is employed.

Addition of AuthLDAPBindMethod to allow binding to LDAP servers implementing kerberos authentication.

Changed AuthLDAPSearchScope parameter to be initialized in the ldap_auth_config_rec structure directly.

Changed get_ldap_val to acquire only the requested attribute from the ldap record. This must be done to allow the module to function when authenticating against a highly secure ldap server that denies access by field.

Replaced calls to ldap_open with ldap_init to conform with deprecation of ldap_open.

Addition of extended information regarding the ldap errors on searches.

Fixed attribute value return to concatenate all values. This fixed false authorization failures that occurred when more than one group attribute instance appears in a record.

Repaired hole in returning AUTH_REQUIRED for unencrypted password comparisons when DECLINED should have been returned. This was occurring regardless of the setting of AuthLDAPAuthoritative. Repaired a similar hole in the group based authorization.

Changed group validation to allow the user to be authenticated if no group is identified and no group attribute is identified.
