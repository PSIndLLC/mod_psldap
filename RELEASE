Revision 0.96
===================
SUMMARY
This release addresses the introduction of compatibility for Apache 2.4, changing the module initialization binding to use providers for authorization to regain compatibility with Apache's new authorization implementation.

Additional changes include improved management for renaming the base location of the installation to something other than /psldap - however this is not yet fully tested. Requisite changes appear to be mostly manageable through psldap_config.js and DSML_sitefrags.xsl - provided the index file on the installation directory is changed to index.xml from index.html

Add handling connection to LDAP through port 636 / TLS

Introduction of password change feature

Add some support for SSHA prefixes to password attributes

Fixes for group authorization

Improved handling of gif and jpeg image presentation from attributes

Preparation for consumption and presentation of some HTML5 data types 

Preliminary work has also been started to allow for export / import of google contacts in their published CSV format.

Also included are some changes to begin implementing compatibility / leverage of features available in HTML 5.
