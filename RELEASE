Revision 0.94
===================
SUMMARY
The latest release of mod_psldap provides new core capabilities to support new actions to register users, add ldap attributes and client side drag and drop editing of the LDAP records to reassign records to superiors, people to managers, and members to groups. A client side form validation framework was also introduced that simplifies validation through leverage of custom attributes on the input elements.
