Revision 0.92
===================
SUMMARY
The latest release of mod_psldap is a patch fix against 0.91 to address defects identified in extended testing. This is a bug fix release to address variations on the initially tested configurations and restores isolation of site specific configurations to simplify an upgrade.

DETAIL
Moved common capabilities back out of DSML_sitefrags.xsl to leave that 
stylesheet for site specific customizations only - common capabilities are now 
in DSML_commonscript.xsl

Refactored the pageHeader template with pageHeaderWithRefClass to reduce 
duplicate code

Removed some hardcoded values from the DSML_vendors.xsl (enabled automatic 
population of the ldapDomains to all select elements with an id of 'dn') and 
made the template for servicesMgmt site specific

Corrected minor title setting bug on commonscript XSL

Extended vcard to include KEY, REV, PRODID, and CLASS, also fixing IM references
to be compliant with RFC 4770

Fixed generated dsml structure to better match spec - pushed searchResponse 
back under a batchResponse node and change mgmt and org XSL back to reference 
the correct XPath

Fixed improper ServerPath inclusion in fully qualified path assembly - repairs 
issue with XML and XSL file parse for server side operations when recursive path
link is not present
